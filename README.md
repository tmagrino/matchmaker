CS5150-Matchmaker
=================

Set-up
- Install MySQL
- Create database
  - Run MySQL Command Line Client
      
      ```
      > CREATE DATABASE matchmaker;
      > USE matchmaker;
      ```
      
- Set the database user and password in src/META-INF/persistence.xml
- Install and start Apache Tomcat (ver. 7)
- Copy build.properties.in to build.properties and set `catalina.home` to the
  location of tomcat
- Build using the command:

    ```
    $ ant dist
    ```

- Copy the *.war file from build/ to [tomcat installation]/webapps/
- Deploy the webapp in tomcat

Development Notes
- src/META-INF/persistence.xml maintains a list of all the persisted objects,
  try to keep this up to date (eventually this should probably become something
  that's automatically generated by the build process)
- web/WEB-INF/web.xml should be modified to use the appropriate "welcome-file"
  before building
  - login.jsp for local testing
  - select-role.jsp for deployment with Cornell NetID

Backend Notes
- Major, Minor, Interest, and College classes are all entities in order to make
  them extensible by admins users.
- No SQL lines are needed with JPA (updated with EntityManager)
